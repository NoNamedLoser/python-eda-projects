# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains [briefly describe rows, columns, and what the data represents].

## Questions Answered
- What are the key trends in the data?
- Are there missing values or outliers?
- How do key variables relate to each other?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Identified major trends and distributions
- Detected missing values and outliers
- Observed relationships between important variables

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how EDA helps understand data structure and generate insights before advanced modeling or reporting.
